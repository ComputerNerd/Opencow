<h1>Opencow: Open Layer for Unicode</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Opencow is an open-source friendly replacement library for the Microsoft Layer
for Unicode. This library allows a Unicode Windows application to run on all
versions of Windows including 95, 98 and ME.</p>


<h2>Licence</h2>
<p>Opencow is tri-licenced with MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1 in the same manner as the
Mozilla project is. See the file
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/opencow/opencow/LICENCE.txt?rev=HEAD">LICENCE.txt</a>
for the text of the licence. The
short version of this means that Opencow may be used in both open-source and
closed-source commercial projects.</p>


<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Opencow is does not currently support the complete API that MSLU supports. See
the MSDN documentation for details of which API calls are supported by MSLU.
See the file src/opencow.def for the list of which API calls are currently
supported by Opencow. The intention is to eventually support the same API set
that MSLU supports such that opencow.dll is a complete MSLU replacement.</p>


<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
<li>Modify your application to build in Unicode mode

<li>Download the binary release of opencow.dll

<li>Download the latest release of libunicows, see links (a).

<li>Build your project, ensuring that the first library on the link line is
   libunicows. See the documentation of libunicows for details.

<li>Distribute your application with opencow.dll in the same directory as the
   application.
</ol>

<h2>Building</h2>

<ol>
<li>If compiling with Visual Studio 6 you will need to install the Microsoft
   Platform SDK. See links (c). Visual Studio .NET doesn't require the
   Platform SDK to compile the project.

<li>Open opencow.dsw and build all projects.
</ol>

<p><b>Notes:</b>

<ol>
<li>There is a feature(?) in VS.NET 2003 which prevents libunicows from
   overriding the unicode API when linking with debug information. You
   must build using VC6, or use the release version of the application
   in order to test libunicow/opencow.
</ol>


<h2>Technical Description</h2>

<p>The Microsoft Layer for Unicode (MSLU or Unicows) is a DLL (unicows.dll) and
import library (unicows.lib) distributed by Microsoft which allows a single
32-bit unicode application to run on versions of Microsoft Windows which do
not natively support unicode applications (95, 98 and ME). The Microsft
library is unsurprisingly distributed under a licence which is not compatible
with open source software (b).

<p>The support for Unicode on Windows 95/98/ME is provided by implementing the
Unicode Win32 API in the DLL. This DLL is not used by Windows platforms
which natively support unicode, but only by Windows 95/98/ME. Internally
the unicode Win32 API translates strings between the unicode encoding used
for input and output parameters and the multi-byte codepage strings supported
by the OS, calling the ANSI Win32 API with the translated strings.

<p>This project, the Open Layer for Unicode (opencow) is designed to be a
drop-in replacement for the MSLU, providing the exact same functionality with
an open source compatible licence. The final deliverable of this project is a
single compiled DLL (opencow.dll) which implements the same external interface
as the Microsoft DLL. This DLL is used by software projects along with
libunicows (A).

<p>This project came about due to the Mozilla project's need to have an
open-source compatible library for MSLU and is expected to be used to provide
Win32 unicode functionality for Mozilla (b).
