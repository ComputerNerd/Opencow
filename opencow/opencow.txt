Summary

An open-source friendly replacement library for the Microsoft Layer for Unicode.
This library allows a Unicode Windows application to run on all versions of 
Windows including 95, 98 and ME.


Technical Description

The Microsoft Layer for Unicode (MSLU or Unicow) is a DLL (unicows.dll) and 
import library (unicows.lib) distributed by Microsoft which allows a single 
32-bit unicode application to run on versions of Microsoft Windows which do 
not natively support unicode applications (95, 98 and ME). The Microsft 
library is unsurprisingly distributed under a licence which is not compatible 
with open source software (1).

The support for Unicode on Windows 95/98/ME is provided by implementing the 
Unicode Win32 API in the DLL. This DLL is not used by Windows platforms 
which natively support unicode, but only by Windows 95/98/ME. Internally 
the unicode Win32 API translates strings between the unicode encoding used 
for input and output parameters and the multi-byte codepage strings supported 
by the OS, calling the ANSI Win32 API with the translated strings.

This project, the Open Layer for Unicode (opencow) is designed to be a 
drop-in replacement for the MSLU, providing the exact same functionality with 
an open source compatible licence. The final deliverable of this project is a 
single compiled DLL (opencow.dll) which implements the same external interface 
as the Microsoft DLL. This DLL is used by software projects along with 
libunicows (2).

This project came about due to the Mozilla project's need to have an 
open-source compatible library for MSLU and is expected to be used to provide 
Win32 unicode functionality for Mozilla (1).
